Vector Dot Product Calculator using a Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) Unit
This project implements a vector dot product calculator on a Digilent Basys 3 FPGA board. It reuses a Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit to compute the dot product of two 4-element vectors, where each element is an 8-bit integer.

Course: COL215 - Digital Logic and System Design
Institution: Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi

Project Overview
The primary goal is to compute the dot product of two vectors, A and B:
$$ \text{Dot Product} = \sum_{i=0}^{3} A[i] \times B[i] $$
The design uses a controller to manage data flow into a MAC unit, which performs the core multiplication and addition operations. The final result is displayed in binary on the board's LEDs and in hexadecimal on the 7-segment displays.

File Descriptions
.v (Verilog Files): These files contain the Hardware Description Language (HDL) code for the design.

mac_unit.v: The core Multiply-Accumulate unit from a previous assignment.

dot_product_controller.v: The main controller that manages vector storage, input selection, and orchestrates the MAC unit operations.

top.v: The top-level module that connects the controller to the physical inputs (switches, buttons) and outputs (LEDs, 7-segment display) of the FPGA.

testbench.v (Verilog Testbench): A simulation file used to verify the functionality of the Verilog design before synthesizing and implementing it on hardware.

.xdc (Xilinx Design Constraints): This file maps the ports defined in the top-level Verilog module (like clk, sw, led, seg) to the physical pins on the Basys 3 FPGA board.

.bit (Bitstream File): This is the final configuration file generated by the Vivado software. It is downloaded to the FPGA to program it with the designed circuit.

Hardware and Software
Hardware: Digilent Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA Board

Software: Xilinx Vivado Design Suite

How It Works
Inputs
The system is controlled using the slide switches and the center pushbutton on the Basys 3 board.

Data Input (SW[7:0]): Used to provide the 8-bit value for an element of vector A or B.

Vector Index Select (SW[9:8]): Selects the element index (0 to 3) you want to write to.

00: Index 0

01: Index 1

10: Index 2

11: Index 3

Write Enable (SW[13] & SW[14]):

SW[13]: Set high to write the value on SW[7:0] to the selected index of Vector A.

SW[14]: Set high to write the value on SW[7:0] to the selected index of Vector B.

Computation Start (SW[15]): Set high to begin the dot product calculation.

Reset (BTNC): The center pushbutton resets the system, clears the accumulator, and displays "-rSt" on the 7-segment display.

Outputs
LEDs (led[15:0]): Display the final 16-bit dot product result in binary.

7-Segment Display (an[3:0], seg[6:0]): Displays the final dot product in hexadecimal. The four digits are time-multiplexed to appear as a single, stable number.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>

Open in Vivado:
